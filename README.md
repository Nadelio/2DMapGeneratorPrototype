# 2D Map Generator Prototype

This was so annoying to make.\
The JNoise library saved me so much headache. Thanks a million Articdive!\
This was a fun experiment. It doesn't make the _best_ maps ever, but it does give a really nice starting point for players and game masters.\
At least in terms of interesting terrain. If you are trying to make something that has more... ground? Then definitely just copy `G` over and over into your game map until you get your map size.\
Then build your structures and water ways and everything.\
This generator doesn't also build the `Interactables Map`, because that would've added a whole new level of complexity to the project that I didn't want to add just yet.\
Maybe in the future I'll do something like that. _Maybe._
